              Working at a computer brings regular distruptions of calendar
              events, emails, texts, etc. Hideaway is a mac app that helps you
              get rid of these distractions for a set amount of time so you can
              focus. When you hit Start Hideaway, it closes all apps + websites,
              hides your dock, and turns on Do Not Disturb for the amount of
              time you have set. When the timer is done, it shows your dock and
              allows notifications again.
